# Road Accidents
## Overview
This project involves analyzing road accidents data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve road safety. The analysis explores key variables such as road type, vehicle type, location, light conditions, and casualty type.

## Dataset Used
- [Dataset](https://github.com/Shaz-Techie/Road-Accidents/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Data.xlsx)

## Requirements
- What is the Total number of casualities for each year.
- Casualities comparison for two years Month-on-Month.
- Total Casualities by vehicle type for each year.
- Total Casualities by location, Light Conditions, Road Type, Road Surface.

## Findings
- Car casualities are the highest contributing 80% of the total.
- Single Carriage Way roads record highest number of casualities.
- 67% of casualities happened on Dry Road Surface.
- Urban localities are more prone to casualities than rural counterparts.
- More accidents took place during the day than night.
- more than 7000 people died in casualities over two years while over 350,000 faced serious injuries. 
## Recommended Actions
- Investigate all possible reasons for car accidents(speed, alcohol, mobile usage etc.) and implement targeted road safety campaigns focusing on car drivers.
- Review road infrastructure and consider converting single carriage way roads into dual carriageways where possible to reduce head-on collisions.
- Investigate why such a high percentage of accidents occur on dry road surfaces. Focus on road conditions such as uneven surfaces,gripless roads, potholes, or loose gravel that could 
  contribute to accidents even in dry conditions.
- Install more traffic calming measures like speed bumps, roundabouts, and pedestrian crossings to reduce the number of accidents in urban areas.Increase awareness and safety campaigns 
  targeting urban drivers and pedestrians.
- Focus on improving emergency response systems by ensuring timely medical assistance and better-equipped hospitals in high-accident areas.
